Repeat the pattern!

## How to play
You are given 5 lives at the beginning of each game.

At the beginning of each level, a pattern of green blocks will appear on the screen and your job is to memorize it.

Once the pattern disappears, replicate the pattern by clicking on the blocks. You will level up once all the green blocks are found. If you click on a block that is not part of the pattern, you will lose a life.

Special level - the green blocks will appear in a certain order. If you manage to get the order correct, you will be granted a bonus life, yay!
